## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**
### **Overview**
The README Reactor 2.0 comes with a radioactive design, and you don't need to be a nuclear scientist to operate it. Gone are the days of dull, uninspiring READMEs; the RM Reactor 2.0 injects energy and excitement into your documentation, ensuring it grabs attention and keeps readers engaged.

By answering a few questions, you'll give the Reactor the essential elements to run a fusion that will result in an atomic README.md for your repo, following best practices. Remember: a great project needs a great README.

## Get Started
Once you have the repo on your computer running `git clone`, open your command line. Make sure to open the README Reactor 2.0 repo folder in your terminal. Use `npm i` to install all the modules needed to run the Reactor.

First clone:
```bash
$ git clone [repo]
```
Then install the modules:
```bash
$ npm i
```

## Usage
The Reactor is easy and intuitive to use. To run it, open the README Reactor 2.0 repo folder in your terminal, then type `node index.js` and hit `enter`. You'll see a glitchy title, but don't worry â€” it's not malware; it's the app intro animation.
```bash
$ node index.js
```

Next, the Reactor will ask you for your repo and user name. Be sure to write an existing GH repo and user name to continue. If you don't have a license, the Reactor will recommend getting one.

After that, you'll ride in automatic; answer the questions and hit `return` after each answer.

Finally, you'll be given the option to include a demo in your README. If you choose to do so, you'll need to place an asset in the `./Atomic_README/assets/` directory and press enter. You'll then receive a confirmation that your README is ready. The file will be generated in the `/Atomic_README` folder.
